            <h3>Choosing a Text Editor</h3>

                <p>Choosing a text editor. I have chosen to go with VS Code as my text editor through Code Fellows. I have been using Visual Studio for a few years now and I am pretty familiar with its features. It appears VS Code is just a simple version of Visual Studios. I plan to go through 102, 201, and 301 while bouncing between a windows machine and an Apple and since VS Code works with both I think it will be the best option for me.</p>

                        <li>test\ something - the \(back slash) is a escape character to tell the terminal to not pay attention to the next character.</li>
